A children's playground game based on hopscotch. Involves color & shape recognition along with hopping. Uses a rangefinding motion sensor hooked up to an Arduino, and Processing for game code.

My partner and I were testing the motion sensor on this window ledge by placing over hands on the correct shape based on the game's commands. It was easier to test the distances at this level. 

Our playtests took place with the entire strip taped to the ground so that it wouldn't move around when people stepped on and off quickly.
